1.
Free providers

You'll need a website hoster. Now your gonna wanna start out free if its your first time designing a site, or even making a business in general. Below is a list of great free 
website providers that you can use to your advantage.

- Canva
- Wix
- W3schools

Sites like W3schools are great for HTML coding, solely based on making a site with HTML, with an AI assistant to make code and design it to be exactly what your site needs.
Canva and Wix are more or so templates where you can design it with elements in a library already there, and ready to go by just dragging them into the box. These are more for 
beginners who just started making a site, and need additional assistants or are not familiar with HTML or .JS

2.
Priced providers

There are the free, and there are the priced.
Priced providers are mainly priced because they have more powerful abilities with a wider range of unique possibilities that your site could end up being like.
Again, below is a list of providers that are priced that you can also use.

- Ionos
- Shopify
- Canva premium
- Wix premium
- Squarespace
- Chetu
- Website.com
- Web.com


All of these are priced and require a renewing subscription, but all for the better. I personally used Ionos, and you can see it's possibilities on my site, 
https://www.joshuadwclark.com and the best part, Ionos comes with free domain guard from WhoIs and comes with SSl certification as well.
