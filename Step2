Gaming

If your not designing a game site, skip this.
Your home page needs to be appealing, something people would think fits the vibe between professionalism and casualism. An abstract background with many colors will do, or you 
could use an iFrame 

<iframe src="url" title="description"></iframe>

Or just embed a looped video in the background. A quick tip. The longer the video, the slower users' computer experience using your games will be. A shorter video, usually around
10 minutes, which is quick and easy to load, will speed up their gaming experience and in-depth description on your site.

Professional

If your designing a more professional site that sells products or different services like videos, then continue here.

    If your designing a product, you need to make a design first and create the image in your head. Then if you have the image at hand, embed it into your site as a product
    or use a selling provider like Shopify to sell your products.
